ChainGuard – Predict Disruptions Before They Happen
Overview

ChainGuard is an AI-powered early warning system that predicts supply chain disruptions and delivery delays before they impact business operations. By continuously analyzing historical shipping data, real-time weather conditions, port congestion, and geopolitical events, ChainGuard transforms fragmented signals into actionable, forward-looking insights.

Instead of reacting to delays after they occur, businesses can anticipate risks, take preventive action, and protect revenue.

Problem Statement

Global supply chains have become increasingly complex and fragile. Even a single delayed shipment can trigger a cascade of issues:

Inventory stockouts

Lost sales and broken SLAs

Customer dissatisfaction and churn

Emergency expedited shipping costs

Operational firefighting across teams

Today, most businesses rely on reactive tracking systems that only report delays after they happen. There is little visibility into future risk, leaving decision-makers unprepared.

For mid-sized companies, the average cost of a single supply chain disruption ranges from $100,000 to over $1 million, depending on severity. As disruptions become more frequent due to climate volatility, port congestion, and geopolitical instability, this reactive approach is no longer sustainable.

Solution

ChainGuard shifts supply chain management from reactive to predictive.
